Colombian" sound to it  Juanes co produced this record  working with a two time Academy Award winning producer  Gustavo Santaolalla  It has been said that the album has typical Colombian sounds  such as the "guasca " "vallenato " and "cumbia " When choosing the name for this record  Juanes was inspired by a conversation he had with his mother  who told him to "Not worry  because life is just a moment " Following what that phrase means  Juanes thought of creating an album remembering that life passes you by in a blink of an eye and concentrating more on his family and beloved beings  1  The first single "Me Enamora" was released on September 3  2007 to the media and online stores  such as iTunes and reached number one in 19 countries  The second single is "Gotas de Agua Dulce"  This album won the Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Album  and the lead single "Me Enamora" also received three awards for Record of the Year  Song of the Year and Best Short Form Music Video  2  At the Grammy Awards of 2009 this album won for Best Pop Latin Album  3  This album was reissued on September 15  2008 with three new songs and eight tracks recorded live on
