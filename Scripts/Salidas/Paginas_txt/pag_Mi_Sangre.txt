Edition' of the album was released  This specially packaged re release of Mi Sangre is an individually numbered  limited edition of 150 000 copies  Within its triple gatefold are two booklets — the CD's lyric book  a fold out booklet with full credits of the current version  and many press quotes  The CD contains the regular album's 12 tracks  live versions of "A Dios le Pido " "La Camisa Negra " "Fotografia " and "Nada Valgo Sin Tu Amor"  Bonus tracks include "La Paga"  which features Taboo from The Black Eyed Peas  a remix of "La Camisa Negra " and the unreleased track "Lo Que Importa"  "Lo Que Importa" was originally made for the album "Fijate Bien"  The second disc is a DVD featuring all four videos shot for the album  The 2005 Mexican double CD contains the regular album's 12 tracks too  but different bonus tracks and no DVD  Just like the regular Tour Edition  it contains bonus tracks "Lo Que Importa" and "La Paga"  though the other bonus tracks are songs from his debut album Fíjate Bien  "Nada " "Fíjate Bien" and "Podemos Hacernos Daño"  This edition also contains two other bonus tracks  an acoustic version of his first worldwide hit "A Dios le Pido" and a different remix of "La Camisa Negra " As result of the big success after releasing "La Camisa Negra" at the end of 2005 and beginning of 2006  a Special European Tour edition was also released  The only difference between this version and the regular version is that the European version doesn't have the unreleased track "Lo Que Importa"  The album also has a remix of "La Camisa Negra"  In June 2006 a 2 disc limited edition was released in Germany  The first disc is the same as the Special European Tour edition  The second disc includes 6 songs performed live from the Shepherds Bush Empire in London  The album was huge success in the United States  As of January 23  2006  the album has been certified 8x Platinum by the RIAA for shipping 800 000 copies in the country  Track listing edit
