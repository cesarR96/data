Zaragoza Museum   Vicente Juan Masip  also known as Joan de Joanes  La Font de la Figuera 1507 – Bocairent 1579  was a Spanish painter of the Renaissance period  He is commonly considered the foremost member of the Valencian school of painters  His father was Vicente Masip  Andilla 1475 – Valencia 1545   and his son was Vicente Masip Comes  c  1555–1623   known as Vicent de Joanes  who imitated his style  citation needed  His two daughters  Dorotea Joanes  d  1609  and Margarita Joanes  d  1613   were also painters  1  His most prominent pupil was Nicolas Borras  citation needed  Biography edit  Born in La Font de la Figuera  he is said to have studied his art for some time in Italy due to Sebastiano del Piombo's influence  with which school his affinities are closest  but maybe he never went to Italy  and he received this influence by the Italian peintures arriving to Valencia  Furthermore  two Italian painters Paolo da San Leocadio and Francesco Pagano  were engaged by cardinal Rodrigo Borgia for painting in Valencia Cathedral  Otherwise  the greater part of his professional life was spent in the city of Valencia  where most of the extant examples of his work are now found  All relate to religious subjects  and are characterized by dignity of conception  accuracy of drawing  beauty of color  and minuteness of finish  He died at Bocairent  near Xàtiva  while working on an altarpiece in the church there  Since his name Macip made him sound like a laborer  macero   he adopted the name of Joan de Joanes  and the heraldry of that family of nobility  He painted a Raphaelesque Holy Family for the sacristy in the Cathedral of Valencia  He never painted a profane subject  and emulated Luis de Vargas and Fra Angelico  in never painting unless he had received holy communion  Painting for him was a solemn exercise  an oratory process  full of prayers and fasts  He never lacked church patronage  the archbishop of Valencia  St  Thomas of Villanova  ordered a set of cartoon panels about the Life of the Virgin to model for some tapestries  He also painted for the churches of the Jesuits  Dominicans  Minims  Augustinians  Franciscans  and for the churches of San Nicolás  Santa Cruz  Carmen Calzado  St Esteban  Corona  Temple  San Andrés  San Bartolomé and San Miguel de los Reyes  Among his best works is the Immaculate Conception painted for the Jesuit church  supposedly inspired by a revelation undergone by the painter's confessor  Father Martin Alberto  Macip also painted portraits      Last Supper  h  1562   The first Eucharist  depicted by Juan de Juanes  mid late 16th century  Museo del Prado   References edit       Greer  Germaine  The Obstacle Race  The Fortunes of Women Painters and Their Work  London  New York  Tauris Parke  p  16
