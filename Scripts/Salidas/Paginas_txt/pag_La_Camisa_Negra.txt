this file  See media help    "La Camisa Negra" is written in common time in the key of F sharp minor  2  The song is carried by a heavy bass guitar and an acoustic guitar strum at a moderate 100 beats per minute  with an accompanying melody on the electric guitar  2  The lyrics are organized in the common verse chorus form  3  and Juanes' range spans around an octave and a half  from C 4 to F 5  2  Lyrics edit  The lyrics explain that the bitter singer is wearing La Camisa Negra  the black shirt  as a way of mourning a failed love affair or even his own death  presumably singing to the object of his love  Some of the lyrics have double meanings or are structured to suggest more off color phrases  Several sentences seem ready to end with an obscenity  before gliding into a new sentence that begins with a similar but non obscene word  The sad lyrics are dissonant with the cheerful melody  4  Critical reception edit        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with the English speaking world and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject  You may improve this article  discuss the issue on the talk page  or create a new article  as appropriate   October

exhibits his guitar style and absorbing voice " 5  MyVillage gave the song two out of five stars  commenting that it "has a certain charm about it  but I certainly won't mind missing the boat on this occasion " 6  IndieLondon called the song "a supremely slick acoustic ballad"  stating that "the rolling guitar licks…provide a wonderful accompaniment " 7  OMH gave the song a mixed review  stating that "the powerful chorus has a rather catchy vocal melody to it" but that "it's like being promised a culinary banquet only to be served a few chicken nuggets " 8  Controversy edit  The song was used in Italy in support of neo fascism because of the association of "black shirt" with the Fascist Blackshirts of Benito Mussolini  9  and many nightclub attendees from the far right raised an arm in the fascist salute when the song was played  10  In response  left wing media network Indymedia called for a boycott of the song  10  Juanes later stated that "'La Camisa Negra' has got nothing to do with fascism or Mussolini   People can interpret music in all kinds of ways I guess " 11  The song was also banned in the Dominican Republic for its sexual undertones  12  It was also implicated in controversy at his August 2009 performance in Havana  13  14  Chart performance edit  In the United States  the song performed quite well for a Spanish language recording reaching number eighty nine on the Billboard Hot 100  15  It performed much better on the Latin charts  topping the Hot Latin Tracks for eight non consecutive weeks  16  topping the Latin Pop Airplay  and reaching number two on the Latin Tropical Airplay  15  Billboard listed the song at number two on the 2005 year end Hot Latin Songs chart  behind fellow Colombian singer songwriter Shakira's "La Tortura"  17  The song performed well in Europe  topping the charts in Austria  Denmark  France  Germany  Italy  Spain  and Switzerland and reaching the top twenty in Belgium  Finland  Ireland  the Netherlands  and Norway  18  The single was certified gold in Switzerland 19  and it is one of the Top 10 singles in the country's history  20  As of August 2014  it is the 51st best selling single of the 21st century in France  with 395 000 units sold  21  Music video edit  A music video for the song was released in 2005  In the video  Juanes arrives in a town  accompanied by two women and an older man  The man and women exit the car  and the man begins playing a guitar while the two dance  Various people are shown in realist street scenes  A wave comes out of the guitar  and aside from Juanes  everyone through whom the wave passes is frozen in time  performing the same motion repeatedly in forward and reverse  During the last chorus  the wave reverses direction  and the people of the town disappear  The waves emitted by the guitar are sucked back in to the guitar  It is unexplained the identity of the women and the old man  and their motives  but it is assumed that they are sinister and possibly they are not even humans  The song and video appear in the video game Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 3 and Dance Dance Revolution X2  Cover versions edit  In 2007  Mexican singer Lucero included a live version with mariachi of this song on her album Lucero En Vivo Auditorio Nacional  Live cover version from Kylie Minogue in Bogotá 2008  KylieX2008  In 2009  the University of Rochester Midnight Ramblers recorded a contemporary a cappella version of the song for their 8th studio album  "Ca C'est Bon"  Fox's 2009 TV Show Glee in episode 3 "Acafellas " a cover version of this song was heard in background  There is also an Iranian version of the song entitled "Beverley Hills" by group Barobax  Dutch band 3JS covered the song in 2011 as a b side for their Toen Ik Jou Vergat single  There is a several Russian cover versions of this song made by different artists  inc  Ярилов Зной  Марк Тишман  Игорь Пресняков  etc   Formats and track listings edit  12" maxi single  House Remixes   "La
